A typical-themed 3D bar where AI "worker agents" hang out waiting for task assignments. Assign tasks to four distinct agents — **Nova**, **Quinn**, **Rune**, and **Sol** — and watch them work through configurable MCP (Model Context Protocol) adapters, all rendered in a neon-lit Three.js bar scene.

## Features

### 3D Bar Scene
- Full WebGL bar environment rendered with **Three.js v0.170.0**
- GLB model loading (bar scene, beer mugs, crowd) with procedural fallbacks
- Four stylized agents with sunglasses, smirks, name-label sprites, and beer mugs
- Idle/working animations (bobbing, swaying, leaning forward)
- Angry leave animation when assigned a task (red glow, stomping, turning away from bar)
- Walk-back and beer sip animation when returning from a completed task
- Orbit camera controls, raycasting for click/hover selection
- Selection rings and hover tooltips

### Agent System
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Nova** | Logistics Lead |
| **Quinn** | Data Whisperer |
| **Rune** | Ops Alchemist |
| **Sol** | Field Liaison |

- Assign tasks with title, instructions, ETA, and MCP adapter selection
- Task progress pipeline: connect → MCP tool calls → process → result → verify → done
- Per-agent task history and working animations

### MCP Adapter Registry (19 Built-In)
| Adapter | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 🐙 **GitHub** | Real | Repo, issue, and PR fetching via GitHub REST API |
| 📁 **Filesystem** | Simulated | File read/write/list operations |
| 🤖 **AI Search** | Real | LLM-powered queries via multiple AI vendors (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Ollama, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity) |
| 🗄️ **Database** | Simulated | SQL query execution |
| 💬 **Slack** | Real | Channel messaging via Slack API |
| ⚡ **Terminal** | Real | Live shell command execution (PowerShell / bash) |
| 🔷 **Atlassian** | Simulated | Jira/Confluence integration |
| 🟠 **HubSpot** | Simulated | CRM contact/deal management |
| ☁️ **AWS** | Simulated | Cloud infrastructure management |
| 📧 **Email** | Real | Email operations via SMTP/IMAP |
| 📅 **Calendar** | Simulated | Calendar event management |
| 📊 **Monitoring** | Simulated | System/application monitoring |

Custom adapters can be added through the MCP configuration modal. Adapter settings persist to `localStorage` (web mode) or the **OS keyring** (Tauri desktop mode — Windows DPAPI, macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret).

### Real API Integrations
- **Multi-LLM AI Search** — proxied through the Node.js server (web) or Rust backend (Tauri) supporting 9 vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity) with per-agent rolling conversation context (3-min TTL, max 5 message pairs)
- **GitHub REST API** — fetch repos, issues, and PRs when configured with a token
- **wttr.in** — real weather data with natural language location extraction
- **Wikipedia** — web search fallback via MediaWiki API

### UI Panels
- Bar stage (3D canvas)
- Agent roster grid with status indicators
- Task assignment form with adapter selection
- Active tasks list with progress bars and step logs
- Work Output pane (streaming response feed)
- Agent Output pane (final results)
- Activity Log table
- MCP configuration modal
- Toast notifications

## Prerequisites

### Desktop App (Tauri)
- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **Rust** (1.77.2+ — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)
- An **LLM API key** (optional — needed for AI Search adapter; supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity, or local Ollama)

### Web Mode (Browser)
- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- An **LLM API key** (optional)

No `npm install` required for web mode — all client dependencies (Three.js) are loaded via CDN import maps.

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmarti8895/agent-bar-hangout.git
cd agent-bar-hangout
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file (optional)
Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env        # Linux / macOS
Copy-Item .env.example .env # PowerShell
```
Then edit `.env` and set any keys you need (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`). See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all available options. Other LLM vendors can be configured at runtime in the MCP Configuration modal.

### Desktop App (Tauri)
```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:dev      # Development (hot-reload)
npm run tauri:build    # Production binary
```

This launches the native desktop window (1400×900). The Rust backend provides OS keyring credential storage, LLM proxy, service proxies, and terminal execution.

### Building Executables

Platform-specific build scripts are in the `artifacts/` folder. Each script installs dependencies, runs `npm run tauri:build`, and copies the resulting installers to `artifacts/builds/`.

| Platform | Script | Output |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Windows** | `./artifacts/build-windows.ps1` | `.exe` NSIS setup installer |
| **Linux** | `./artifacts/build-linux.sh` | `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` |
| **macOS** | `./artifacts/build-macos.sh` | `.dmg`, `.app.tar.gz` |

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\artifacts\build-windows.ps1

# Linux / macOS
chmod +x ./artifacts/build-linux.sh   # or build-macos.sh
./artifacts/build-linux.sh
```

Build outputs are written to `artifacts/builds/`.

> **Note:** You must build on the target platform — cross-compilation is not supported by Tauri. Linux builds require additional system dependencies (see the script header for details).

### Running the Desktop App

After building, run the app using the installer or standalone executable from `artifacts/builds/`:

| Platform | How to Run |
|----------|-----------|
| **Windows** | Run `Agent Bar Hangout_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (NSIS installer) to install, then launch from the Start Menu. Or run `agent-bar-hangout.exe` directly (standalone, no install needed). |
| **Linux** | Install via `sudo dpkg -i *.deb` or `sudo rpm -i *.rpm`, then launch from your app menu. Or run the `.AppImage` directly: `chmod +x *.AppImage && ./*.AppImage` |
| **macOS** | Open the `.dmg`, drag the app to Applications, and launch from the Dock/Spotlight. Or extract the `.app.tar.gz` and run the `.app` bundle directly. |

The desktop app runs fully standalone — no Node.js server needed. LLM proxying, credential storage, terminal execution, and service integrations are all handled by the built-in Rust backend.

### Web Mode (Browser)
```bash
node server.js
```
Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

The port defaults to `8080` and can be changed via the `PORT` environment variable.

---

## Testing

### Playwright E2E Tests (59 tests)
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npx playwright test
```

### Unit Tests (52 tests)
Covers location extraction, weather API calls, multi-city fetches, edge cases, and LLM proxy integration.

```bash
node test-web-fetch.mjs
```

For tests that exercise the LLM proxy endpoint, start the server on port 3000 first:
```bash
PORT=3000 node server.js
# In another terminal:
node test-web-fetch.mjs
```

### Hermes Integration (dev)

The dev server now exposes a minimal Hermes-compatible assignment endpoint and a small persistent memory API for integrations and testing.

- `POST /api/hermes/assign` — Accepts a flexible Hermes-style payload and stores a normalized task in the server memory store (`memories.json`). Example body:

```json
{
  "taskId":"hermes-1",
  "title":"Check inventory",
  "instructions":"Count bottles on shelf A",
  "etaMinutes":15,
  "targetAgent":"Nova",
  "metadata": { "priority": "high" }
}
```

- `POST /api/memory/get` — `{ key?: string }` returns stored values (omit `key` to get full store).
- `POST /api/memory/set` — `{ key: string, value: any }` stores values persistently to `memories.json` (dev only).

Notes: these endpoints are intentionally lightweight for local development. For production use, secure them and switch to a proper database backend.

- **18 location extraction cases** — parsing cities from natural language weather queries

- **Multi-city fetches** — concurrent weather lookups
- **Edge cases** — bare queries, Unicode characters, malformed input
- **LLM proxy** — end-to-end multi-vendor AI proxy integration (requires running server)

## Usage

1. **Select an agent** by clicking their card in the roster or clicking them in the 3D scene. Use arrow keys to cycle.
2. **Assign a task** using the task form — enter a title, instructions, pick an MCP adapter, and set an ETA.
3. **Watch progress** in the Active Tasks panel as the agent works through the pipeline steps.
4. **View results** in the Work Output and Agent Output panes.
5. **Configure adapters** via the MCP Configuration button — add API keys, endpoints, or create custom adapters.
